# PizzaCode-Cook
This PlaygroundBook's purpose is to give to the user the opportunity to cook a pizza while understanding basic commands about coding such as for loops, dictionaries, boolean and integer values. It's pretty easy, indeed I design it for kids or people who never approach to coding and programming languages or at least just a bit.  I tried to keep it simple as much as possible, from the assets and the colors to the animations and the coding logic.   I used just a few technologies to keep it simple such as UIKit and AVFoundation for the background music. Furthermore, I used PlaygroundBook Template and Playground Support library in order to manage the user input through the different live view.
